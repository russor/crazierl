// We give GRUB this information using a standard known as 'Multiboot'.
// To define a valid 'Multiboot header' that will be recognised by GRUB, we need to hard code some
// constants into the executable. The following code calculates those constants.
.set MB_MAGIC, 0x1BADB002          // This is a 'magic' constant that GRUB will use to detect our kernel's location.
.set MB_FLAGS, (1 << 0) | (1 << 1) // This tells GRUB to 1: load modules on page boundaries and 2: provide a memory map (this is useful later in development)
// Finally, we calculate a checksum that includes all the previous values
.set MB_CHECKSUM, (0 - (MB_MAGIC + MB_FLAGS))
